ideas:
you could make a live gui changer where you open a config file that is read semi-frequently (or with bin).
program the config file (which is basically just css; possibly included via #include) to 
resize windows, change the layout, etc... 
    specifically, what i want is gtk builder because it loads xml at runtime

frequently check for memory leaks

implement gtk, glib, and cmake

plan:
okay so I found a book that teaches the mysical ways of x, so I think I should read that 
as x is the foundation of what the wm

after that... I really don't know exactly how or if I can use gtk. It looks like x has 
a few different toolkits for making widgets, gtk was not listed. I don't plan on reinventing 
the wheel or using things for other than their intended purpose; too many projects have gone 
sideways doing otherwise.
