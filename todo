you could make a live gui changer where you open a config file that is read semi-frequently (or with bin).
program the config file (which is basically just css; possibly included via #include) to 
resize windows, change the layout, etc... 
    specifically, what i want is gtk builder because it loads xml at runtime

frequently check for memory leaks

implement gtk, glib, and cmake
