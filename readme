An x client, disguised as a de or wm.

deps:
	x client library package for your package manager. The package is usually named something like 'libxcb' or 'libxcb-dev'.
	xcb stands for x window in c binary or something like that; It's the stadard headers and blobs that all x applications use.
	Other than that, this just uses the c standard library.
